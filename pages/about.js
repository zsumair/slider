          The Islamic Society of Greater Houston (ISGH) was established in 1969
          in the heart of the City of Houston. Our start was humble, organic and
          purposeful. In the late 1960s a group of Muslim students from the
          University of Houston as well as other young professionals and their
          families used to meet and pray at each others' houses. It was a small
          community then and the first Eid was prayed in the house of one of the
          founders of the society.
